    "# Chaos Engineering with Litmus\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "Use LitmusChaos to inject failures into Kubernetes clusters to validate system resilience and uncover weaknesses before they become outages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features:\n",
    "- Target pods, nodes, or services for controlled failures\n",
    "- Simulate CPU/memory spikes, pod deletions, network loss\n",
    "- Validate SLOs, observability, and auto-healing mechanisms\n",
    "- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for chaos as a test step\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tech Stack:\n",
    "- Kubernetes (kubectl)\n",
    "- LitmusChaos\n",
    "- Python for orchestration (`subprocess`, `yaml`)\n",
    "- Optionally GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Prometheus/Grafana\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions:\n",
    "1. Set up Litmus in your cluster:  \n",
    "   `kubectl apply -f https://litmuschaos.github.io/litmus/litmus-operator-v3.yaml`\n",
    "2. Choose or create a ChaosExperiment CRD (YAML)\n",
    "3. Use Python to dynamically apply ChaosExperiment YAML\n",
    "4. Monitor the results via `ChaosResult` CRDs\n",
    "5. Log/alert based on outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Scenarios:\n",
    "- Delete a pod randomly and validate restart\n",
    "- Induce CPU stress for 60 seconds on a container\n",
    "- Simulate network latency or DNS loss"
