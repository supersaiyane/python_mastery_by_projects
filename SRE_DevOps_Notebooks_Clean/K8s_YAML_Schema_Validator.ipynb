    "# K8s YAML Schema Validator\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This project focuses on implementing **K8s YAML Schema Validator**, a hands-on exercise tailored for DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Understand the Problem Statement\n",
    "- Research the purpose of **K8s YAML Schema Validator**.\n",
    "- Identify the key challenges it aims to address in production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Design the Architecture\n",
    "- Draft a high-level architecture diagram.\n",
    "- Identify tools or platforms (e.g., AWS, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Prometheus, Terraform, etc.) you will use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Setup Environment\n",
    "- Create a local or cloud-based dev environment.\n",
    "- Set up Docker, Kubernetes, or any dependencies.\n",
    "- Initialize Git repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Write the Code\n",
    "- Implement scripts or configs (e.g., YAML for K8s, Terraform modules, Python scripts).\n",
    "- Ensure modularity and clear logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Testing\n",
    "- Unit test and integration test your components.\n",
    "- Simulate failure conditions where applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Deployment\n",
    "- Deploy your solution using CI/CD pipelines or manual steps.\n",
    "- Monitor deployment logs and validate behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Observability & Alerts\n",
    "- Add metrics, logs, and alerts relevant to this project.\n",
    "- Use tools like Grafana, Prometheus, or ELK stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: Review and Optimize\n",
    "- Review performance metrics and reliability outcomes.\n",
    "- Refactor or tune configurations for efficiency.\n",
