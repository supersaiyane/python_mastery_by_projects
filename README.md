# 🐍 Python Mastery by Projects

Welcome to the **Python Mastery by Projects** roadmap — your complete, structured, and project-driven learning system to reach the level of a 5-year experienced Python developer.

This repository is designed for developers who:
- Have tried learning Python multiple times but couldn’t stick to it.
- Prefer **hands-on learning over tutorials**.
- Want to learn **Python the way professionals use it in the real world**.

---

## 🧭 Roadmap Structure

Each level includes:
- ✅ **20 Conceptual Questions** — to solidify your understanding of core principles.
- 💻 **20 Coding Problems** — to sharpen your problem-solving and logic-building.
- 🧪 **2 Real-World Projects** — to simulate professional development and apply your skills.
