# 🐍 Python Mastery by Projects

Welcome to the **Python Mastery by Projects** roadmap — your complete, structured, and project-driven learning system to reach the level of a 5-year experienced Python developer.

This repository is designed for developers who:
- Want a **hands-on, question-driven approach** to Python.
- Need **real-world projects and challenges** beyond tutorials.
- Are preparing for **FANG interviews, DevOps, and SRE roles**.

---

## 🧭 Roadmap Structure

The repository is divided into 7 sections:

1. **01_beginner** — 20 Conceptual Questions, 20 Coding Problems, 2 Projects.
2. **02_intermediate** — 20 Conceptual Questions, 20 Coding Problems, 2 Projects.
3. **03_advanced** — 20 Conceptual Questions, 20 Coding Problems, 2 Projects.
4. **04_expert** — 20 Conceptual Questions, 20 Coding Problems, 2 Projects.
5. **05_devops** — 30 DevOps-focused Python coding problems.
6. **06_sre** — 30 SRE-focused Python coding problems (SLIs, SLOs, automation).
7. **07_dsa** — 50 FANG-level Data Structures & Algorithms questions.
